# Personal Website Starter Prpkect

This is a place for you to start building your first project -- your personal website!

Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html

This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

## ← portfolio.html
This will be your portfolio page.  

## ← script.js

Later this week, you'll get fancy with the ability to add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. For now, there's no need to edit this file!

## ← styles.css

The file for your styles! You don't need to worry about editing this file right now. You'll learn more about CSS styling tomorrow.
