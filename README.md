# Personal Site Starter

This is a place for you to start building your first project -- your personal website!

Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html

This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

## ← script.js

Starting tomorrow, you'll get fancy with the ability to add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. For now, there's no need to edit this file!

## ← styles.css

The file for your styles!
